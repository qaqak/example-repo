# example-repop
This is an example LPM repository to give you an overview of how they work
## The root of the repository
The main branch of all LPM repositories contains information for LPM to read and add to the `repos.json` file.

Here is an example:
```
/*
    Linux Package Manager v1.0.0
    Copyright (c) 2022 Qasim Khan
*/
{
    "example-repo": {
        "url": "https://github.com/qaqak/example-repo/"
    }
}
```
Not much, eh?
TODO!!!!
